      <p>Alexa became a Product Manager at DefMethod after working with their team on her own start-up at the time, aflutter. A SaaS product that connected event production vendors, their teams, and clients as they made logistical decisions affecting their day of timeline. This idea was born from her experience as a small business owner of Anna Rose Floral & Event Design. She is an innovative thinker who has traversed a variety of industries from economic development to retail grocery to event production to building technology software. Her passion lies in creating an integrative work environment for both the customer and the business team creating the product. Outside of work, she works with womxn to connect with their hormonal cycles as a digital health coach.</p>

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong> I became a partner in a small business that was not setup with digital tools to conduct business. For example, the floral shoppe was still using paper work orders in 2012. The process of finding the right tool then onboarding my team and implementing its use within our daily workflow allowed me to experience the value of technology as well as its hurdles in solving simple problems. I was curious about how to build tech products so I took a UX course with General Assembly. It completely changed my approach to my business and changed the trajectory of my career. </p>

From the moment I understood how software could be leveraged to solve meaningful problems, I was hooked."

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong>
      &quot;My Dad worked in computer manufacturing, so we always had computers and spare parts around the house to tinker with when I was growing up.  I saw them more as fun toys to play with rather than a career aspiration.  That changed while I was working on my senior research project at Wesleyan.  I'd spent months unsuccessfully trying to levitate a droplet of liquid so my adviser and I could observe how it oscillated.  Seeing my frustration, my adviser suggested I try creating a computer simulation.  In less than a month, I had a working visualization written in C++ and spent the rest of the year adding features and exploring the physics of fluid dynamics.  That experience showed me the power that software has to improve our understanding of the world and set me on my career path.&quot;

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong> "I got my first taste of programming when I accidentally stumbled across my browser's developer tools at the age of 11.  Realizing that there were far more languages than and uses for HTML (other than pranking friends), I became increasingly fascinated by the world of computer science."</p>

      <p>Walker is a loving Pekingese Beagle, originally from New York. He loves hugs and keeps us warm on those
        cold winter days. Walker is playful in nature, and is occasionally seen doing tricks on Nick's skateboard.
        He is very fond of rides on Keith's back. Walker has been in the Tech Space for two years. He firmly believes
        in agile methodologies, small/regular commits and does not approve extra-large pull requests. <br><br>
        Fun facts: Walker can balance treats on the tip of his nose, then tilt his head back and eat them. Very cool.</p>
