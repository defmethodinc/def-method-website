    <div id='background'>
      <p>Katie is an experienced product leader with a passion for using data, analytics and empathy to connect with customers. When she was young, this blend of analytical and creative thinking was reflected in her love of playing the piano (creating melodies from musical structures on paper), studying the overlap between Art and Physics (think Dali’s melting clocks and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity), and writing poetry about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (isn't it poetic that our bodies are comprised of electrons in uncertain locations?). Now, as an adult, she pursues this passion by merging storytelling and technology to execute products, flexing her creative and analytical muscles as needed to be the hub between different types of talents, working together to ultimately drive customer satisfaction. </p>

    <div id='developer'>
      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong> "My first "real" job was working at a small educational center in Brooklyn, where kids in Kindergarten through 8th grade came to improve their math, reading and writing skills. While the academic instructors were of course pivotal to students' successes, equally important was the role technology played: assessing student strengths and weaknesses, serving up customized lesson recommendations, and adapting skills to each student individually as they progressed through the curriculum. Technology then became a means by which we could help our kids more effectively and connect more deeply with parents. It became clear to me that understanding technology was a critical component in reaching larger goals and in making a more meaningful impact." </p>

    <div>
   <p><strong>ON THE JOB</strong>
Balanced multiple users’ needs to launch a digital campaign management platform
Katie joined a team working on a new digital campaign management platform, which had a wide user base, competing goals and priorities across different stakeholders, and a tight timeline until launch. When Katie joined, the team was trying to make too many people happy at once, and in the process making no one happy (especially themselves!). With the launch date already set, Katie worked expeditiously with cross functional teams to cut through the noise to understand and create alignment around the key problems for which the product was trying to solve. With a more focused set of goals in mind for the near term, and a clear vision for the long term, Katie was able to work with her team of engineers and designers to prioritize needs and features and launch the platform on time. As a result, the productivity of media traders - the prioritized users - increased by 60%. This win propelled the team to proudly move forward on future priorities and features.</p>

<p>Launched a new learning management system to better meet the needs of a rapidly growing student body 
Katie led a strategic initiative to onboard a new online learning tool for students looking to launch new careers in technology. The existing online tool would not be able to successfully handle the amount of growth projected in the next year. Katie used the “jobs to be done” framework to deeply understand the needs of a diverse set of students and stakeholders in order to evaluate new systems. Instead of blindly incorporating old features into the new learning management system, this framework provided a fresh perspective on how we were addressing pain points by focusing on the job that the old feature was doing, rather than the feature itself. This created space for the cross functional team to quickly prioritize needs rather than features, in order to imagine a completely new student experience.</p>

<p>Saved on operational costs by 30% while creating a better customer experience
When working with a pre-college test prep company, Katie led an operational initiative to lower the costs of students taking free proctored SAT and ACT practice tests at testing centers, while reducing the amount of time to provide students with their practice test results and feedback. The existing process relied on proctors collecting test grids, sending them to the company’s home office where another team scanned the tests and emailed the results to students and parents. This took too long and was too resource intensive. Further, the longer the student had to wait for results (sometimes up to 10 days with this existing process!), the less likely they were to purchase a test prep program. In order to solve this problem, Katie worked with a team of engineers and subject matter experts to design a webgrid - a mobile responsive web application for students to enter their test answers into in order to get immediate results. The results were impressive: a significant reduction in operational costs while simultaneously creating a better student experience and business results.<p>

A SaaS product that connected event production vendors, their teams, and clients as they made logistical decisions affecting their day of timeline.

She is an innovative thinker who has traversed a variety of industries from economic development to retail grocery to event production to building technology software. Her passion lies in creating an integrative work environment for both the customer and the business team creating the product.

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong> I became a partner in a small business that was not setup with digital tools to conduct business. For example, the floral shoppe was still using paper work orders in 2012. The process of finding the right tool then onboarding my team and implementing its use within our daily workflow allowed me to experience the value of technology as well as its hurdles in solving simple problems. I was curious about how to build tech products so I took a UX course with General Assembly. It completely changed my approach to my business and changed the trajectory of my career. </p>

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong> "I transitioned into the tech world from being a filmmaker. Video game development served as a bridge between the two fairly disparate worlds of movies and tech. But the overlap was there of creative group problem solving and this has always been something I’ve thrived doing. I really knew I wanted to do something in tech when I realized I wanted to make innovative “tools" for people that would empower them. My focus has shifted somewhat over the years but the core values of innovation and empowerment still guide me powerfully."</p>

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong>&nbsp;"Back when I was using only Excel, I was manually
        combing multiple separate csv files to create a weekly reports. After doing this time-consuming (and error-prone) task a few
        times, I thought there had to be a better way of doing this and there was - with a simple, reliable command line script. 
        That was when I discovered the power of programming."</p>

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong>
      &quot;My Dad worked in computer manufacturing, so we always had computers and spare parts around the house to tinker with when I was growing up.  I saw them more as fun toys to play with rather than a career aspiration.  That changed while I was working on my senior research project at Wesleyan.  I'd spent months unsuccessfully trying to levitate a droplet of liquid so my adviser and I could observe how it oscillated.  Seeing my frustration, my adviser suggested I try creating a computer simulation.  In less than a month, I had a working visualization written in C++ and spent the rest of the year adding features and exploring the physics of fluid dynamics.  That experience showed me the power that software has to improve our understanding of the world and set me on my career path.&quot;
