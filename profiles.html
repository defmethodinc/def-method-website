      <p>Katie is an experienced product leader with a passion for using data, analytics and empathy to connect with customers. When she was young, this blend of analytical and creative thinking was reflected in her love of playing the piano (creating melodies from musical structures on paper), studying the overlap between Art and Physics (think Dali’s melting clocks and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity), and writing poetry about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (isn't it poetic that our bodies are comprised of electrons in uncertain locations?). Now, as an adult, she pursues this passion by merging storytelling and technology to execute products, flexing her creative and analytical muscles as needed to be the hub between different types of talents, working together to ultimately drive customer satisfaction. </p>

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong> "My first "real" job was working at a small educational center in Brooklyn, where kids in Kindergarten through 8th grade came to improve their math, reading and writing skills. While the academic instructors were of course pivotal to students' successes, equally important was the role technology played: assessing student strengths and weaknesses, serving up customized lesson recommendations, and adapting skills to each student individually as they progressed through the curriculum. Technology then became a means by which we could help our kids more effectively and connect more deeply with parents. It became clear to me that understanding technology was a critical component in reaching larger goals and in making a more meaningful impact." </p>

It started with me wanting to build video games, which caused me to pursue a BA in Computer Science. While studying my major, I realized the vast influence programming has had and continues to have in our lives. From then, I knew I wanted to make a bigger impact than just creating something fun and entertaining. After getting my BA in Computer Science I attended the Flatiron School for Web/Software Development where I learned the skills needed to build those impactful services." </p>

      <p>Alexa became a Product Manager at DefMethod after working with their team on her own start-up at the time, aflutter. A SaaS product that connected event production vendors, their teams, and clients as they made logistical decisions affecting their day of timeline. This idea was born from her experience as a small business owner of Anna Rose Floral & Event Design. She is an innovative thinker who has traversed a variety of industries from economic development to retail grocery to event production to building technology software. Her passion lies in creating an integrative work environment for both the customer and the business team creating the product.

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong> I became a partner in a small business that was not setup with digital tools to conduct business. For example, the floral shoppe was still using paper work orders in 2012. The process of finding the right tool then onboarding my team and implementing its use within our daily workflow allowed me to experience the value of technology as well as its hurdles in solving simple problems. I was curious about how to build tech products so I took a UX course with General Assembly. It completely changed my approach to my business and changed the trajectory of my career. </p>

      &quot;My Dad worked in computer manufacturing, so we always had computers and spare parts around the house to tinker with when I was growing up.  I saw them more as fun toys to play with rather than a career aspiration.  That changed while I was working on my senior research project at Wesleyan.  I'd spent months unsuccessfully trying to levitate a droplet of liquid so my adviser and I could observe how it oscillated.  Seeing my frustration, my adviser suggested I try creating a computer simulation.  In less than a month, I had a working visualization written in C++ and spent the rest of the year adding features and exploring the physics of fluid dynamics.  That experience showed me the power that software has to improve our understanding of the world and set me on my career path.&quot;

Realizing that there were far more languages than and uses for HTML (other than pranking friends), I became increasingly fascinated by the world of computer science."</p>
