      <strong>Current Location</strong>: Brooklyn, NY <br>

    <div class='background'>
      <p>Katie is an experienced product leader with a passion for using data, analytics and empathy to connect with customers. When she was young, this blend of analytical and creative thinking was reflected in her love of playing the piano (creating melodies from musical structures on paper), studying the overlap between Art and Physics (think Dali’s melting clocks and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity), and writing poetry about the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle (isn't it poetic that our bodies are comprised of electrons in uncertain locations?). Now, as an adult, she pursues this passion by merging storytelling and technology to execute products, flexing her creative and analytical muscles as needed to be the hub between different types of talents, working together to ultimately drive customer satisfaction. </p>
    </div>

    <div class='developer'>
      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong> "My first "real" job was working at a small educational center in Brooklyn, where kids in Kindergarten through 8th grade came to improve their math, reading and writing skills. While the academic instructors were of course pivotal to students' successes, equally important was the role technology played: assessing student strengths and weaknesses, serving up customized lesson recommendations, and adapting skills to each student individually as they progressed through the curriculum. Technology then became a means by which we could help our kids more effectively and connect more deeply with parents. It became clear to me that understanding technology was a critical component in reaching larger goals and in making a more meaningful impact." </p>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <p><strong>ON THE JOB</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Balanced multiple users’ needs to launch a digital campaign management platform</strong></p>
      <p>Katie joined a team working on a new digital campaign management platform, which had a wide user base, competing goals and priorities across different stakeholders, and a tight timeline until launch. When Katie joined, the team was trying to make too many people happy at once, and in the process making no one happy (especially themselves!). With the launch date already set, Katie worked expeditiously with cross functional teams to cut through the noise to understand and create alignment around the key problems for which the product was trying to solve. With a more focused set of goals in mind for the near term, and a clear vision for the long term, Katie was able to work with her team of engineers and designers to prioritize needs and features and launch the platform on time. As a result, the productivity of media traders - the prioritized users - increased by 60%. This win propelled the team to proudly move forward on future priorities and features.</p>

      <p><strong>Launched a new learning management system to better meet the needs of a rapidly growing student body</strong></p>
      <p>Katie led a strategic initiative to onboard a new online learning tool for students looking to launch new careers in technology. The existing online tool would not be able to successfully handle the amount of growth projected in the next year. Katie used the “jobs to be done” framework to deeply understand the needs of a diverse set of students and stakeholders in order to evaluate new systems. Instead of blindly incorporating old features into the new learning management system, this framework provided a fresh perspective on how we were addressing pain points by focusing on the job that the old feature was doing, rather than the feature itself. This created space for the cross functional team to quickly prioritize needs rather than features, in order to imagine a completely new student experience.</p>

      <p><strong>Saved on operational costs by 30% while creating a better customer experience</strong></p>
      <p>When working with a pre-college test prep company, Katie led an operational initiative to lower the costs of students taking free proctored SAT and ACT practice tests at testing centers, while reducing the amount of time to provide students with their practice test results and feedback. The existing process relied on proctors collecting test grids, sending them to the company’s home office where another team scanned the tests and emailed the results to students and parents. This took too long and was too resource intensive. Further, the longer the student had to wait for results (sometimes up to 10 days with this existing process!), the less likely they were to purchase a test prep program. In order to solve this problem, Katie worked with a team of engineers and subject matter experts to design a webgrid - a mobile responsive web application for students to enter their test answers into in order to get immediate results. The results were impressive: a significant reduction in operational costs while simultaneously creating a better student experience and business results.

    <div class='developer'>
      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong> I became a partner in a small business that was not setup with digital tools to conduct business. For example, the floral shoppe was still using paper work orders in 2012. The process of finding the right tool then onboarding my team and implementing its use within our daily workflow allowed me to experience the value of technology as well as its hurdles in solving simple problems. I was curious about how to build tech products so I took a UX course with General Assembly. It completely changed my approach to my business and changed the trajectory of my career. </p>

   <p><strong>ON THE JOB</strong></p>
   <p><strong>An MVP delivered in two weeks to reduce risk and validate product concept</strong></p>
   <p>Pager, a social media start-up company, came to Def Method with a detailed plan of a product to build. After discussions with the client, Alexa identified the need to understand a single customer persona with a specific problem to build out an initial MVP before tackling all of the problems the client looked to solve. A strong believer in user testing and validation, Alexa ran continuous experiments in a 2-week timeframe to efficiently test the business problem and release an initial version of the product, needing only a basic amount of code and resources to do so. As a previous small business owner, Alexa recognized the need for validation and reduction of risk to ensure that the client’s investment would be successful and leveraged effectively. By quickly delivering a clean, basic product to gain feedback, Alexa was able to use the data collected to confidently build out a more developed product.

   <p><strong>Pivoting product strategy to effectively adapt to a COVID-impacted industry</strong></p>
   <p>In 2020, Alexa worked with a client in an industry significantly affected by COVID-19. In a time of rapid transition, Alexa immediately began identifying areas that needed to pivot in order to support the business and its customers, while maintaining financial stability. Having already been tracking the pandemic from a holistic perspective, Alexa prepared for a drastic change in the economic reality and readied herself to address the difficult business questions that would arise. Taking a critical look at the progress already made and future product strategy, Alexa worked with the client to develop a plan that put a pause on new features and focused on a digital launch to best serve and stay connected to customers during the pandemic. Due to the impact on customers’ ability to interact with the product in its original form, Alexa focused on developing new user personas through research to understand how to iterate on the existing product to continue encouraging user engagement. In combination with the digital launch, the enhanced understanding of COVID-impacted users will lead to a product pivot, setting up for success in an new and unfamiliar economy.</p>

As such, she brings deep technical knowledge to her clients, along with her expert ability to find the root of a problem, scope a project, and deliver feasible results. At Def Method, Merziyah has worked on 14+ products focused on driving startups to their MVP. A generalist at heart, Merziyah has extensive experience with B2C and B2B products, across various industries, such as healthcare, finance, and consumer goods.</p>

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to work in tech?</strong> "I have always been fascinated by computers starting back in the day when I installed Lotus Suits by feeding in 30 3.5" hard disks and learnt what software had to offer. Today it's the application of technology to solve basic human problems in unique and innovative ways that fascinates me." </p>

   <p><strong>ON THE JOB</strong></p>
   <p><strong>Balancing cost and value to prioritize clients’ needs</strong></p>
   <p>On a government-run project working with the Campaign Finance Board (CFB), Merziyah worked within a fixed budget to maintain and enhance a platform used by campaigns to collect contributions. As a product experiencing increased user growth, there was a need to refactor and optimize the feature set to support the growing user base. To ensure that the optimizations would remain within the scope of the client’s budget, Merziyah critically evaluated the cost of addressing issues via support, versus optimizing the product in order to balance time and resources appropriately. Through the evaluations, she helped the client determine which opportunities needed allocation of engineering resources for a permanent solution and which issues were better to deprioritize.</p>


   <p><strong>Experimentation to improve team performance</strong></p>
   <p>Merziyah was asked to jump in on a project where the team was flustered, disorganized, and unable to deliver around on the set expectations. Unable to set realistic timelines, the engineers often scrambled to finish requested features, resulting in the production of non-prioritized and technically faulty code. Merziyah was able to quickly identify the root cause of the issues as lack of engineering involvement and lack of data for accurate estimation. Through continuous experimentation of agile team processes, such as weekly planning and grooming, regular retrospectives for team feedback, and collection of velocity, time tracking, and delivery date data, Merziyah increased the productivity of the team. These processes gave engineers the opportunity to be more hands on and committed to user stories, improving their motivation and ability to succeed. The data collected gave the team the ability to reflect on past work to better estimate future work. The process concluded with increased productivity due to happier engineers who were able to set the right delivery expectations with the stakeholder.</p>

   <p><strong>Identification of core challenges to feasibly build a product</strong></p>
   <p>A non-profit client was looking to build a new member center for their website that would allow their donors access to new features as well as the ability to manage their donations online. Although seemingly straightforward, the challenge was that the clients’ website operated on one CMS system, but the donation data was driven by a donor CRM system without a clear link of data between the two systems. Merziyah talked to different teams across the organization to better understand the nuance of how the systems were set up, how the data could be linked between the two, and what the technical challenges of doing so were. Applying her technical knowledge, Merziyah identified the required data exchange in order to present a solution to connect the online portal to the donor CMS system. Going above and beyond the fundamentals of developing a product roadmap, Merziyah took her role to the next level by identifying exactly where the challenges and considerations were before launching and building the product. In doing so, she mitigated the risk of losing donors by laying out the necessary product requirements in order to ensure a seamless integration between the donor’s online experience and client’s backend donor CRM.

        Having not written code previously this felt like a difficult task to complete. After reading through manual that came with the STAMP board that we were using
        I was finally able to get the robot to turn left in response to waving my hand infront of a sonar sensor mounted to the front of the robot's chassis.
        That was the moment I knew I was hooked on learning about software development.

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong>
      &quot;My Dad worked in computer manufacturing, so we always had computers and spare parts around the house to tinker with when I was growing up.  I saw them more as fun toys to play with rather than a career aspiration.  That changed while I was working on my senior research project at Wesleyan.  I'd spent months unsuccessfully trying to levitate a droplet of liquid so my adviser and I could observe how it oscillated.  Seeing my frustration, my adviser suggested I try creating a computer simulation.  In less than a month, I had a working visualization written in C++ and spent the rest of the year adding features and exploring the physics of fluid dynamics.  That experience showed me the power that software has to improve our understanding of the world and set me on my career path.&quot;

      <p><strong>When did you know that you wanted to be a developer?</strong> "I was always considered the 'technical one' at home growing up. This meant setting up TV's (VCR's, if anyone remembers those!), Stereos or just anything that was plugged in or took batteries. In general, I have always loved learning and understanding how things worked. I did a HTML course when I was younger but when I wrote my first 'Hello World' in Java, I knew this was where I wanted to be."</p>
